## use randomness
## start at square 1 win at or grater than square 70
## winner gets a pile of carrots and lettuce
## occasionally lose ground because of mountain path
## clock time is one iteration of moveing/turn -- one turn per second
## use variables to keep track of the positions of the animals (1-70)

## slip left before square 1 move to square 1 -- idk if the position is less then 1 move to 1?

## produce a table wih precentages for a random variable "i" in range [1,10]
## if the tortoise rolls between [1,5] it is fast, [6,7] it is a slip, [8, 10] it is slow
## same for the hare

## start the race by printing "BANG!!!!!AND THEY'RE OFF!!!!!"
## every iteration should show a line of length 70 which represents the race positions
## these should show a "T" and "H" for the tortoise and Hare respectively
## if both land in the same square tortoise bites hare and print "OUCH!!!"
## in case of a tie it should be blank -- idk?
## after displaying the move/turn check if H/T position is >= 70
## if true for T print "TORTOISE WINS!!! YAY!!!"
## if true for H print "Hare wins. Yuch"
## if there is a tie either favor T as "underdog" or print "it's a tie"

## involve a crowd of some kind to enjoy the race -- idk should be virtual or irl?
